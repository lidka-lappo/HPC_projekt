This project is fragment of my bigger work conected with analisys
of nucei after annihilation with antiproton

Data from my simulation is in way_of_production.txt file.

The data is stored in form of wektors. It represents the different nuclei that are transformed into first nuclei with diffrent frequencies.

Data for one nuclei is stored into two lines - first one with isotops, second with frequencies.

Here I developed and optimiezed algoritm for finding the best way of syntesyzing diffrent elements. This is relevant for my future work. 

In timing.h are declared fuctions for timming. 


Main algoritm is implemented in best route.cpp
It parses the input file to extract information about isotopes and their production quantities.
Utilizes structures to organize and store production data and route information.
Creates routes based on the production data.
Routes are generated by traversing the isotopes and their production quantities.
Provides information about the generated routes.
Outputs isotopes and their quantities along the routes.
Indicates whether a route is complete or not


Parallel Processing:
    Utilizes OpenMP for parallel processing to enhance performance.
    Parallelism is employed in loops iterating over isotopes and their quantities.
